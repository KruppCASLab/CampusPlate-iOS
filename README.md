# Campus Plate - iOS Client

## About
The iOS client is currently built with UIKit. In the future, we plan on migrating to SwiftUI.

## Building
To build the project, you do need Xcode installed. Once you clone the repository, if you open the xcodeproj file, you should be able to build it and run it on the iOS and iPadOS simulator. It also will run on macOS devices that have a M* chip.

## Adding Endpoint
If you are deploying Campus Plate at your university and would like your university's web service endpoint added to the application, you can submit a pull request containing the change.
